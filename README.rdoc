== Roomable

Roomable is a web (and soon-to-be mobile app) that makes it easier to find the right room and the right roommates. Users can swipe through available rooms or potential roommates, as on Tinder, and can also access usersâ€™ social media links (a standard ask on any Craigslist housing post).

* Ruby
